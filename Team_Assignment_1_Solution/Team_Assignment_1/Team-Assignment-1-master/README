//********** NOTE **********//
This is only the API and the included *.h and *.cpp files complie
but have NO FUNCTIONALITY

IF a main.cpp is inluced with test cases the program can be compiled with the 
$make all OR $make library commands

IF there is no main.cpp the makefile will fail
$g++ -shared -fpic -std=c++11 -o library.so *.cpp
will compile it instead.

We compiled on the linux servers, there for a .so file was included as opposed to
a .dll file
